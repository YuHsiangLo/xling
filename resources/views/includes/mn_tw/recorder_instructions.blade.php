You can see the recording tool on the right-hand side (or below on mobile). The top Recording window shows the level of the incoming sound. The bottom Recording window will show your recording when it is complete. Underneath the two windows are a Playback Control, a Microphone icon, and a Submit icon. To record yourself, click on the Microphone icon (which will glow red), read the passage aloud, and then click on the Microphone icon again to end the recording. The lower window will then show your recording. Clicking on the Play button in the Playback Control will allow you to hear your recording.

If you stumble over a word, you do not need to restart your recording. Simply repeat the sentence like you would in normal conversation. Please read at a pace you find comfortable. There is no need to rehearse before the recording. If you accidentally end or submit a recording before it is finished, please start a new one and keep going until the end.
